# Cat Pictures

#### _React/JS, Cat Pictures, Jake Ash, 2/14/2020_

## Description
According to Rick Hanson, a Senior Fellow of the Greater Good Science Center at UC Berkeley, states that the first few minutesafter waking your mind and body are very receptive to [influence](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-wise-brain/201607/what-do-you-think-about-when-you-first-wake).  With this idea in mind, it is important to start your day off right with something that will help motivate/make you smile.  This application plays to that mindset, where every morning the user will get a picture of a cat sent to their phone number.  Users can register numbers online, and expect to see a picture/gif of a cat every morning at 6 am on the dot. [Business insider (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-wise-brain/201607/what-do-you-think-about-when-you-first-wake)] shows that over 40% of people between 18-29 start off their day by looking at the internet.  Having a funny picture or gif of a cat will help start their day off better, which in turn will leak into the rest of their day.
